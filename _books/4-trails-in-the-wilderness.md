## Book 2 of the Summer Trails Series

Jessa Davies is back, and she’s going horse-camping! She’s been given a
special assignment at the remote teepee camp, where she and Marsha will
be leaders. Jessa worries about the responsibility of being a counselor
when a new problem arises; a gorgeous newcomer threatens to steal Wade’s
attention. What’s more, a sullen camper and a dark mystery threaten to
destroy everything Jessa cares about. 

As things go from bad to worse, Jessa has to make a decision: to hold on
tight to what she wants, or to trust God and let go.
