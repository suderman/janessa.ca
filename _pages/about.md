Janessa Suderman grew up going to horse camp in the foothills of southern
Alberta, Canada, and remembers those years fondly. She bought her first horse
Dawn at the age of 16, and still gets out riding on her as often as possible.
Janessa received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree from Trinity Western
University, and works part-time as a nurse. An avid reader from a young age,
Janessa kept her younger brother entertained by making up elaborate stories to
help him get to sleep. Over the years she has written multiple short stories,
poetry, and novels for leisure. The Summer Trails Series is her first published
work, and she's now writing the second sequel to Sisters in the West. She
currently lives in southern Alberta with her husband and two young sons.
