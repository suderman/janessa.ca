Janessa Suderman is a writer based in Calgary, Alberta. She has always been
naturally creative and artistic, with a love for reading, writing, and singing.  

Janessa grew up out in the country and spent a lot of time riding her horse and
enjoying the outdoors with her family. She graduated from Trinity Western
University in 2009 with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and works part-time as
a nurse. 

Now she thrives at home raising two young sons and bouncing story
ideas off her techie-husband, and writing here and there whenever she gets a
chance. Hope youâ€™ve enjoyed her books!
