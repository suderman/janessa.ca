Claire and Nellie Preston are sisters; but that’s about all they have in
common! 

Claire, a regal disciplinarian, has always kept watch over sweet-and-innocent
Nellie. So when Nellie decides to move to West Peaks, Alberta, all Claire can
do is follow...and try her best to keep Nellie out of trouble! Then a handsome
cowboy comes into the picture, and Claire struggles to keep her heart in check. 

At the same time, Nellie is keeping a huge secret from Claire; one that could
ruin everything. A delicate mystery is rooted in the very core of Nellie’s
soul; and she is determined to bring the truth to light, no matter the cost. 

All the while, notorious outlaw Brown Bart is back in town, and he and his gang
are bad news. The girls have no idea the danger they are in as Bart plots and
schemes, setting his sights on these naive newcomers. 

In a thrilling journey through a wilderness of deceit, self-discovery, and
love, Claire and Nellie must learn to embrace who they truly are: Sisters in
the West.
