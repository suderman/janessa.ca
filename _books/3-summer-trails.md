## Book 1 of the Summer Trails Series

Sixteen-year-old Jessa Davies is going to horse camp; and this year
she’s on staff! She can’t wait to spend her summer as a wrangler; riding
her favourite horse, goofing off with friends, and basically having a
blast. Things go even better than expected when the cutest cowboy at
camp starts paying special attention to her!
 
But things get complicated fast when a co-worker seems to hate her guts.
Jessa starts to question everything; from her crush, to whether she even
has what it takes to be a wrangler. Tempers run high as manipulation
clouds the truth, and Jessa wonders why she ever thought wrangling was
good idea. Through it all she is reminded of God’s love as she rides along
the summer trails.
